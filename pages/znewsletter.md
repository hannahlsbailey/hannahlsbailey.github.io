## Newsletter

As part of my work for the Programme on Democracy and Technology I write a monthly newsletter on China’s Information Operations. This newsletter summarises the latest research on China’s computational propaganda, censorship, strategic use of artificial intelligence technologies, and data manipulation. It highlights the latest reports from investigative journalists and think tanks, reviews the most relevant academic research, and offers insight from the original research produced by the Programme on Democracy and Technology.
