As part of my work for the Programme on Democracy and Technology, I write a monthly newsletter on China’s Information Operations. This newsletter summarises the latest research on China’s computational propaganda, censorship, strategic use of artificial intelligence technologies, and data manipulation. The link to this newsletter can be found [here](https://demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/posts/china-information-operations-newsletters/).
