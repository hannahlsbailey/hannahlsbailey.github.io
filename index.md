My research uses machine learning and natural language processing methods to explore how authoritarian regimes strategically manipulate narratives. Specifically, I focus on the case of China. My current work investigates China’s strategic use of framing in public diplomacy discourse, and the impact this framing has on international narratives. My work has been featured in [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-55666153), [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-china-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-62b13895aa6665ae4d887dcc8d196dfc?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&ut), [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/china-state-tv-channel-cgtn-enlists-uk-student-influencers-dw9v5sbnc) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/army-of-fake-fans-online-boosts-chinas-global-messaging/2021/05/11/e92a9c06-b20e-11eb-bc96-fdf55de43bef_story.html).

I am a researcher and DPhil student at the University of Oxford specialising in social data science and authoritarian computational propaganda. At the University of Oxford I am part of the [Programme on Democracy and Technology](https://demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/). I am supervised by [Professor Philip Howard](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-howard/) and [Dr Tom Nicholls](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/communication-and-media/staff/tom-nicholls/). 

I hold a BSc in Politics and Philosophy from the London School of Economics, as well as two MScs, in Contemporary Chinese Studies, and in the Social Science of the Internet, both from Oxford University. I have also studied Mandarin at Fudan University (Shanghai). My DPhil is generously funded by the Oxford Internet Institute’s Shirley Scholarship.
