I am a researcher and DPhil student at the University of Oxford, specialising in social data science and authoritarian computational propaganda. At the University of Oxford, I am part of the Programme on Democracy and Technology at the Oxford Internet Institute. 

My research focusses on the application of natural language processing and machine learning methods to understand China’s strategic use of framing in public diplomacy discourse. My work has been featured in The New York Times, BBC News, The Times and NBC News. I also write a monthly newsletter on China's Information Operations summarising the latest research on China's computational propaganda, censorship, strategic use of artificial intelligence technologies, and data manipulation.

I hold a BSc in Politics and Philosophy from the London School of Economics, as well as two MScs, in Contemporary Chinese Studies, and in the Social Science of the Internet, both from Oxford University. I have also studied Mandarin at Fudan University (Shanghai). My DPhil is generously funded by the Oxford Internet Institute’s Shirley Scholarship.
